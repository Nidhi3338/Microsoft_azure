## Study guide for Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals
### https://learn.microsoft.com/en-gb/credentials/certifications/resources/study-guides/az-900
- Describe cloud concepts (25–30%)
- Describe Azure architecture and services (35–40%)
- Describe Azure management and governance (30–35%)

### Unit -1
Azure Fundamentals includes interactive exercises that give you hands-on experience with Azure. Many exercises provide a temporary Azure portal environment called the sandbox
a. Define cloud computing.
b. Describe the shared responsibility model.
c. Define cloud models, including public, private, and hybrid.
- Identify appropriate use cases for each cloud model.
- Describe the consumption-based model.
- Compare cloud pricing models.

a. cloud computing is where the PC is in the cloud center insted of physically with us , we only pay for the services used .
- all the cloud provider mainly provide ( compute power and storage)
- compute power : is how much processeing a computer can do and which allows for latest upadte and processing quick
- storage : PC/traditional  has limited hard drive space and cloud make sure its up to date and its backedup

b. shared responsibility model , in traditional computers there where datacenter which was taken care of and if the cilent wanted any details they had to rely on the employee working in datacenter

- Then, for some things, the responsibility depends on the situation. If you’re using a cloud SQL database, the cloud provider would be responsible for maintaining the actual database. However, you’re still responsible for the data that gets ingested into the database. If you deployed a virtual machine and installed an SQL database on it, you’d be responsible for database patches and updates, as well as maintaining the data and information stored in the database.
- as the datacenter has shifted to cloud they have three difrrent models IAAS , PAAS ,SAAS.
- IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other end of the spectrum
-  SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS
-  Saas-Paas-Iaas
-  
-  You’ll always be responsible for:
The information and data stored in the cloud
,Devices that are allowed to connect to your cloud (cell phones, computers, and so on)
,The accounts and identities of the people, services, and devices within your organization

- The cloud provider is always responsible for:
The physical datacenter
,The physical network
,The physical hosts
- Your service model will determine responsibility for things like:

Operating systems
,Network controls
,Applications
,Identity and infrastructure

c. What are cloud models? The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources. The three main cloud models are: private, public, and hybrid.
- It companies use the private which comes with great value and which have datacenters ( in private there are 2 types on permis and host services by 3rd party)
- thirdparty service given by the aws or azure for public cloud
- Hybrid clouds rely on secure network connections, often using technologies like virtual private networks (VPNs)
- **Azure Arc** is a set of technologies that helps manage your cloud environment. Azure Arc can help manage your cloud environment, whether it's a public cloud solely on Azure, a private cloud in your datacenter, a hybrid configuration, or even a multi-cloud environment running on multiple cloud providers at once.
